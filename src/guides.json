            "introduction": "My dad got an old printer from a garage sale and though the printer is excellent it does not have wireless printing. The printer itself is of good quality and for a few dollars it was worth the money. Instead of trying to find some fancy printer, I decided to try to see if I can find a workaround for this. And since I like learning new things, especially related to tech, that is exactly what I did. I used <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/printing-at-home-from-your-raspberry-pi/\">CUPS</a> to along with my <a href=\"https://www.pishop.ca/product/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/\">Raspberry Pi 3B+</a> to turn the printer into a wireless printer! TODO make a guides section and put this in there?.",
