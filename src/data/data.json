One such hape is filament, similar to other light filaments, it usually goes into a bulb that you would screw into your ceiling. I realized recently, that you can buy the individual filements inside the bulb. After some research, I found that the ones that go into the wall sockets are in series so that they can take high voltages at a low current, and alternatively, there are some that are in parallel so they take low voltages and high current. For small projects, the low voltage is easier to produce using small power sources like a USB.",

The LED strip runs at about 2.5V when I tested it, as the power supply is USB will give it 5V, we need resistors to make this work. I used trial and error as the capacitors cannot carry a large load, or in other words, discipate the heat fast enough. So, I simply balanced the amount of current the resistors can handle while still keeping the LEDs bright which resulted in about 30 Ohms. Lastly, we have a capacitor, this is simply to smooth out the input electricity. Since USB can move around and this can cause brief fluctuations, the capacitor is meant to smooth those out so we do not notice as much of a flicker. Then we simply connect this to a USB-C module. Now we can use any USB-C power source to power the lights. The wires are single core so they are fairly sturdy on their own, they worked quite well for this and with some reinforcement should hold well. Note, the version here is brighter but the resistors overheated so the new version uses 3 * 10 Ohms in series to make 30 Ohms.",

This chip can be embedded or something more general purpose. Examples of embedded are <i>Arduino</i> and the <i>Raspberry Pi Pico</i>. These do not have an operating system and will instead execute some code upon startup. On the other hand, a general-purpose computer would have an operating system as well as all the things around it. This means that we can run a script on startup, but we can also do more advanced things like running multiple software and installing frameworks. Examples of general-purpose computers to use for this would be Raspberry Pi Zero and up. In this trial, I will use what is available to me and use the Raspberry Pi 3B+ as I have one lying around. <br /><br />The second component we need is a <b>motor control board</b>. There are a couple of reasons this is a requirement. First, the motor is likely running on a much higher voltage and current than the computer so we cannot connect a motor directly to the computer. Second, the direction of spin on the motor alternates with the current. Meaning, that there is no real + or - on an electric motor but rather it will spin in different directions based on which direction the power is connected. Fun fact, if you use an external source to spin the motor it will generate electricity. The motor controller allows for the current to be switched either way. The compute module will then communicate commands to the motor controller using <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pulse-width-modulation-pwm/\">Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</a> to control the motor speed and direction.<br /><br />The <b>motors</b> are likely just going to be brushed motors. In my case, I will start with using an existing RC car so I can skip the motor gearbox and steering for now. <br /><br />The <b>power source</b> will need to be sufficient for the whole system. In my case I will use a separate power source for the compute module and the motors, this may change in later revisions.",

                            "text": "In short, gpiozero is a library that allows you to access the General Purpose Input Output Pins (GPIO). Please see the latest <a href=\"https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">gpiozero documentation</a> and to get the pinout of your Pi user the <code>pinout</code> command.<br /><br />We will be using the <a href=\"https://python-evdev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">evdev</a> library for reading user inputs, in this case the Bluetooth controller.<br /><br />Lines 11 and 12 are setting up the pins that will be used for the motors, see how to use <a href=\"https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_output.html#motor\">Motor()</a>.<br /><br />Lines 14 to 21 are mapping the buttons from the controller to variables. These were obtained by using <code>cat /dev/input/your_input_device</code> on Linux, which simply listens to the input channel and displays it on the screen. For example, when you press a on the controller the input read by the computer is 304. This is a unique value that will allow us to determine what button is pressed.<br /><br />The way we know a button is pressed is by setting up an event listener for the controller, see line 87. If we can successfully create an event listener, then we listen, see line 24.<br /><br />Line 26 checks what type of event, since the controller filters the events by type of button. Specifically, this statement filters for the ABXY buttons on the controller, the other events including triggers and joysticks are handled after line 42.<br /><br />The button press events are handled on lines 29 to 41. The button press is a boolean event meaning the button is pressed or not.<br /><br />The trigger, on the other hand, allows for values from 0 to 1023. On line 47 we check for the right trigger (line 54 for the left trigger), then we take the read value and normalize it on line 48 to make it a value between 0 and 1. Then we can use the PWM, which is already packaged into the Motor() class and allows us to set a speed between 0 and 1, where 1 is the max speed of the motors.<br /><br />Lines 62 to 70 check if the user is using the controller d-pad to drive. The d-pad is also like a button so it will also be a motor on or off style.<br /><br />Lastly, we read the joystick values on lines 74 to 83. As you can see on line 75, the joystick has a value between 65535 in total. That means that half is for -x and the other half is for +x, the same is true for y. In this case, we are only reading the y value to go forward or backwards. On lines 78 to 83, we apply the speed values from the joystick.",

The main idea of how these work is the same, with a couple of differences. <br /><br />The <b>differences</b> are V+ and CT. This board is powered by the power source connected to it. So, <i><b>V+ is a 5v output</b></i> to power external devices... I found that one out the hard way. According to <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251801663442954.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt\">AliExpress.us</a>, CT is \"the drive current\" and the usage is \"<code>CT Output Voltage(V)=Current(A) x 0.155</code>\" to \"do current-limiting processing\". It seems that figuring out what CT is will need some investigating.<br /><br />Otherwise, everything else is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07GC26TVK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">L298N Module H Bridge Driver</a>, IN1 and IN2 are the PWM controllers for A and B output channels, respectively. And, EN enables each channel. GND is ground as always.<br /><br />Since we are using a small compute board we can use the DBH-1A V+ output to power our Raspberry Pi Pico W through the <a href=\"https://penguintutor.com/electronics/pico-power\">VSYS pin</a>, <b>to clean up the wiring</b>. This means that we will not have to have two power sources, one for the computer and one for the motors, as we did in Iteration 1. Note, the Raspberry Pi Pico W can run on a range of 1.8V - 5.5V, since I am using two 18650 batteries in parallel, I could connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W directly to the power source.",

From the 5v output connected to the board, I added a switch and then connected it to a micro-USB to power the Zero W. With this setup, I can put the cover on the car again since I can charge the batteries and switch off the computer and motors separately.

Overall, I had a lot of control over the car and that made it a lot more fun to interact with.<br /><br />However, I learned something about electric motors that I knew in theory but not in practice. An electric motor has a certain amount of watts that it needs to be able to turn electricity into motion. <code>Watts = Volts * Amps</code> and when you use a PWM, we get the average voltage and amps of whatever we set. This means, when the voltage is low (as a result of low PWM value) the motor creates a huge amount of amps in an attempt to reach the wattage required to create motion. This results in lots of amps creating lots of heat and no motion. <br /><br />The second thing is something I didn’t even know about so my brother, with an electrical engineering diploma, explained it to me. The short version is that when the motor is going in one direction and then suddenly swaps to the other, it creates a power surge. This power surge can get bad enough to damage the motor. <br /><br />In short, the combination of these two as well as overheating from a heavier car fried the drive motor. The steer motor does not take a large draw, nor carry a large load so it seems to be fine. The plastic of the steering has worn down, however. ",

After some investigation, we noticed that the motor and motor controller are still fully operational, but the batteries are all done.

The second component is the <b>Gearbox</b>, basically including gears that allow for more torque or more speed controlled by the switch at the top. Third, the <b>Electric Motor</b>, a device that converts electricity into mechanical rotation. The fourth component is a <b>Motor Controller</b>, which allows the user to set different speeds for the motor by allowing a higher or lower voltage into the motor. Note, a general rule of thumb is that a higher voltage will provide higher speed whereas more amperage will provide more torque. The motor controller is likely the most technical part of all of this but there are just a couple of MOSFETs, switches, diodes, and a spring.

Also, remember that energy is always conserved and as much energy has to go in and come out. The reason I mention the law of conservation of energy is because a cold side is a lack of energy and a warm side is more energy so overall there will be no temperature difference (other than a tiny amount of heat from loss). <br /><br />The hot side will be cooled as much as possible, we do not want the module burning out so we can’t supply too much cooling for the hot side. The cold side is what we need to cool the air and collect the moisture. I know there is more to a dehumidifier but I will have to do some experimentation to determine how to best get this done. ",

This module allows for different voltages to be produced and generally at a high current. They are also not that costly by themselves but you also need the wall plug and wire to support it.

It did work well with 9v, none of the modules overheated, all worked well, and the dimensions seem to mostly fit well. In terms of function, the cold side had a lot of condensation but due to lack of cover from the fan, the fast-moving, hot air evaporated before it could drip to be collected.

Additionally, for more information about semiconductors <a href=\"https://www.sciencefacts.net/semiconductor.html\">sciencefacts.net</a> explaining how those work.<br /><br />A concept that is generally important to consider is the law of conservation of energy and Newton's third law of physics \"every action has an opposite and equal reaction\". That is to say that when solar panels get light, the semiconductors create electricity and heat. When there is no light the solar panel will act as a load, taking electricity to generate heat. This is why there is a diode that makes sure that this cannot happen when there is no light.<br /><br />Otherwise, when solar panels are generating electricity, they can be used similarly to how any other power source works, like a battery. Solar panels, like batteries, can be used in <a href=\"https://www.power-sonic.com/blog/how-to-connect-batteries-in-series-and-parallel/\">parallel or in series</a> to create higher voltages or higher current.",

Additionally, the water in the environment is usually <b> nutrient-poor </b>. So, this plant has two of the three ingredients it needs to survive, the third being nutrients to grow.<br/><br/>Due to the lack of nutrients the plants adapted to catch insects. Additionally, these plants have gotten good at absorbing any nutrients that land on them, so you are not allowed to touch them or risk chemical burns wherever you touch the plant.

It also helps to mist them with water.<br /><br />With regards to <b>climate</b>, these plants live in the warmer parts of the North Americas but still experience a winter dormancy period. During the colder seasons, the leaves (the pitchers) will start to brown and die. Once the frost hits all the leaves will die and all that will be left are the roots.

The rest, bugs, will sort themselves out when the plants are outside, as mentioned they are great hunters. <br /><br />For the <b>soil</b> I used one part peat moss and one part perlite. Peat moss by itself has very little to no nutrients the plant can use while having amazing water retention due to the shredded sphagnum moss inside. <b>Warning,</b> Sphagnum moss is horrible at absorbing water when it is already dry as opposed to humid or damp! However, by itself, peat moss will compact and become hard so it needs something to give it structure. For that, I have used perlite which makes the soil fluffy and does not retain water well, or in other words, provides drainage. The downside of this is that it is not easy to work with and toxic to breathe. There are a couple of alternatives I have been wanting to try like coconut husks. <br /><br />In this case, <b>water</b> will be classified as humidity in the air or the soil. It is important to understand that moisture in the soil is different from mud. In wet highlands, the ground would be fibrous and fluffy meaning that roots have access to water but also to air. There are two things we do to simulate humidity. The first is to put sphagnum moss on top of the soil to cover it. The moss itself holds moisture but as it covers the ground it helps the ground retain moisture as well. The second is that I like to have them stand in a deeper dish and a little bit of water. The bottom of the dish will have some aquarium gravel in it and the pot is less than 10% in the water, really not deep! This allows the soil to constantly absorb moisture without the roots standing in water. The <b>roots should never be submerged in water but should always have humidity</b> around them. ",

With distilled and rainwater I have noticed that the water will turn a black or brown colour and by the end of the year there were red little worms living in it. Not pleasant. With well water, I usually have a lot of algae growing in, which does not harm the Sarracenia while also absorbing nutrients in the water. Algae and Sarracenias seem to have a symbiotic relationship in this case. The water will not be harmful to you or the plant, the water will not be smelly, and it is easy to clean with a simple rinse and dollar-store strainer. I will note that I live in North America meaning that untreated well water is more or less exactly the water these plants are used to, so it makes sense to me that they grow well in it.<br /><br /><b>Light</b> is an easy one if you can put the plants outside in the summer. They need a fair amount of sunlight, I have had them in places where they would get a good 12 hours of direct sunlight in 30 C weather and did not show a sign of stress. Slightly shaded light outside will also often do the trick. Remember, these plants live in the North Americas so the climate here is more or less perfect for them. The reason why I cannot grow them outdoors is that the winters where I am get much too cold. As they are dormant during the winter and the summers are perfect where I live, I do not keep them indoors much. I would imagine you would need strong lights.<br /><br /><b>Dormancy</b> for these plants would happen around November, giving them until about March for dormancy. Dormancy means waiting until the soil is just slightly moist, trimming the leaves off, sprinkling sulphur on top of the soil/moss to avoid mold, and putting them in a fridge. Since the plant is dormant, it will not grow or photosynthesize so it does not need its leaves but it also cannot be completely dry. The dormancy period lasts 3 to 4 months and after that, the plants can be taken out again. Having the plants at about 3C in the fridge seems to be cold enough that it simulates winter for these plants, freezing them should be avoided and will likely kill them.",

The brim will have visible beads of nectar. I touched a bead once and it was sticky and smelled sweet. I want to know what it tastes like but I also don't wanna share a meal with flies if I can help it. This nectar is meant to attract insects to the opening of the pitcher. I have noticed that flies will crawl all over the plant and I suspect that the whole plant is sweet to lure insects. Once the insect notices the nectar they generally attempt to eat it without falling into the hole. The underside of the part of the leaf that covers the opening has many little hairs that the insects cannot hold onto. This design makes the nectar uncomfortable for the flies to reach from the open end, whereas the underside of the leaf is not a place they can stand. Once they try, they tumble into the plant pitcher. Once the bug falls inside the pitcher, they have great difficulty getting out which is for different reasons depending on which subspecies. However, the nectar around the brim and the little hairs are generally how these plants catch their prey. Additionally, flies are attracted to the smell of other dead flies so the plants only attract more insects both with more leaves that provide a sweet aroma as well as the stench of decaying insects. Generally, I don't notice a smell because the plants are good at absorbing nutrients.<br /><br />I read it somewhere, but I have also witnessed that spiders like to make webs on these plants as it attracts a lot of insects, often inevitably leading to the spider falling into the plant.",

When the pitcher opens up, it is initially empty and the inside is also lined with a similar hair that it uses to catch the bug. When the unsuspecting insect falls in it will try to crawl or fly out leading to it rubbing against the hairs lining the inside of the pitcher. Rubbing the leaves causes the plant to produce what is effectively a weak acid to digest the insect. The more the insect struggles the more acid the plant releases. The acid is produced when the hairs are stimulated and stops shortly after. Once the plant catches more bugs, they will fall on top of the bugs that are already being digested, causing more digestive fluid to run down the pitcher and on top of the bugs below. The pitcher is also long and narrow, designed to squeeze the insects inside to cause more digestive fluid production. <br /><br />The <b>Sarracenia Purpurea</b>, on the other hand, does not cover the top part of the pitcher deliberately to catch rainwater. The pitchers themselves are also much shorter and wider, to support the weight of the water and to have more capacity to store it. When the insect falls into the pitcher, it will be trapped in the water. The walls of the pitchers are also made so the insects have trouble climbing them and absorbing nutrients. Once the insect dies and decays, the plant will absorb the nutrients from the water. When more insects fall in, they struggle and stir up the water with all the bits of decaying insects causing the mixture to swirl around which helps the plant absorb it even more.",

Since LEDs are so much more efficient and do not produce nearly as much heat as incandescent light bulbs, they are preferred. For reference, a standard incandescent light will use 60 Watts per hour, whereas the same lamp but LED will use 5 Watts per hour. That means that the cost of powering the incandescent light for <i>one hour</i> can power the same LED light for <i>12 hours</i>! Plants do need heat, but this allows for there to be other sources of heat and it makes it easier to control the temperature in general. I have used regular incandescent lights as heat lamps before and, in certain cases, they work well.<br /><br /><b>White light LEDs</b> have different amounts of colours in the spectrum as seen in the image provided by <a href=\"https://www.softlights.org/chapter-11-color-temperature/\">softlights.org</a>. Since they are likely blue LEDs with a coating, the way the light colours can be controlled through what is known as Kelvin or warmth of light. The lower ends like 2700K white light has little blue light whereas the higher 5000K has a lot of blue light. Sunlight, however, has all the colours in the spectrum also referred to as full spectrum light.

Instead of it meaning, “Go to the nearest plant store or supermarket and buy some general purpose fertilizer.” What it means is that the plant needs minerals. Much like your body needs certain minerals for growth and maintenance, plants do as well. So really, when talking about fertiliser we are talking about minerals that the plants need to grow. ",

These minerals are then used by the plants to grow. For example, onions need sulphur in the soil and in return they <a href=\"http://files-do-not-link.udc.edu/docs/causes/online/Onions%209.pdf\">store sulphur in them</a>. Another example is cucumbers, which <a href=\"https://libanswers.nybg.org/faq/223327#:~:text=Cucumbers%20need%20moderate%20nitrogen%20and,4%2D6)%20is%20good.\">need potassium in the soil to grow</a> and guess what’s <a href=\"https://ingenaes.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/ING-Info-Sheet-2018_05-Cucumber-nutritional-value-Kowalewska.pdf\">inside cucumbers, potassium</a>, among many other minerals. Coincidentally, plants are where we get a lot of our minerals since we <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Mental-Health-ea7d9ba33d7e413cb5a7ac7096ab66bc?pvs=21\">cannot digest dirt</a>. <br /><br />The problem is that when we are farming plants in a small-ish area and they use up the same minerals, at some point certain minerals will deplete and there are two major ways that we can combat this. The first and easiest, plant other plants in that area. Different plants need different minerals so while one plant may struggle in a particular spot, another plant may thrive. And the second, of course, is that we retrieve those minerals from somewhere and put them in the ground ourselves. However, those minerals are often in some form that plants can absorb and then we call it fertilizer.",

The most basic instance of a routing problem is the famous <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/167517\">\"Travelling-salesman problem\" introduced by Merrill M. Flood in 1955</a>. The basic idea is for a single salesman to visit every city with the shortest possible distance. The reason this is a combinatorial problem is because for n cities there are n! different solutions. For example, if there are 10 cities then there are 3628800 different combinations of possible routes, where one route will be the shortest. Since finding the optimal solution when n is large is not possible within a reasonable amount of time, better methods need to be developed. In ACO, the variation is that there are many ants and they make choices based on probability which is based on the distance. Meaning, a given ant can see all the cities and each city will have a probability of being visited based on the distance. So, the closest will have the highest probability and the furthest the least. Additionally, when an ant travels down a path it lays pheromones which can be seen by other ants. The probability will be based on both the distance and the pheromone strength. I implemented this as a visual representation to see how the algorithm works based on a tutorial by <a href=\"https://bsantosa.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/aco-tutorial-english2.pdf\">Budi Santosa (2015)</a>.

The other farmers are angry that you won and start throwing rocks at your pig. The pig is defenceless against getting hit by a rock and will die immediately. Luckily, you are a skilled rock catcher so it is up to you to catch the rocks. While dodging and catching rocks, you find coins on the ground that you can use to buy protection for your pig.<br /><br />See the code on <a href=\"https://github.com/EmanWiens/FlakySuperpower\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>.",
