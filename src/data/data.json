The drill is in decent shape but it is old. We tried it and it did not work, and initially we thought we would just scrap it for parts. Afterall, there is large eletric motor, a motor controller, and a battery and if even 1 of those works then the $5 invenestment my brother made was worth it. After some investigation, we noticed that the motor and motor controller are still fully operational, but the batteries are all done. When I saw the batteries are done, I mean 0 volts and <i>visibly oxidized</i>.",

It is also so old that I cannot find the exact model online, it is a <a href=\"https://www.boschtools.com/ca/en/\">14.4v Bosch Brute drill</a>. The image is the cross section of the drill with the parts annotated. The first component is the <b>Chuck</b>, which is used to fasten the drill bits to the motor. The second component is the <b>Gearbox</b>, basically including gears that allow for more torque or more speed controlled by the switch at the top. Third, the <b>Electric Motor</b>, a device that converts electricity into mechanical rotation. The fourth component is a <b>Motor Controller</b>, which allows the user to set different speeds for the motor buy allowing a higher or lower voltage into the motor. Note, a general rule of thumb is that a higher voltage will provide higher speed speed whereas more amperage will provide more torque. The motor controller is likely the most technical part of all of this but there are really just a couple of mosfets, switches, diodes, and a spring. And lastly, the <b>Battery</b> that powers the device, in this case they appear to be Nickelâ€“cadmium batteries.",

The <b>environment</b> these plants are adapted to live in bogs and wet grasslands. These environments are generally not well shaded due to larger plants' roots suffocating in the water which means <i>near constant direct </i><b>sunlight</b>. Additionally, the water in the environment is usually <b>nutrient poor</b>. So, basically this plant has two of the three ingredients it needs to survive, the third being nutrients to grow. <br/><br/>Due the the lack of nutrients the plants adapted to catch insects. Additionally, these plants have gotten really good at absorbing any nutrients that land on them, so you are not actually allowed to touch them or risk chemical burns wherever you touched the plant. When I repot them I usually make sure to keep my hands wet to dilute anything that might be on my hands. It also helps to mist them with water.<br /><br />With regards to <b>climate</b>, these plants live in the warmer parts of the North Americas but still experience a winter dormancy period. During the colder seasons, the leaves (the pitchers) will start to brown and die. Once the frost hits all the leaves will die and all that will be left are the roots. The roots, or rather the crown, survives the winter and starts growing more leaves, and sometmies flowers, in the spring time.",

                            "text": "There are four main things that we need to match in terms of the environment: <b>soil, water, light, and dormancy</b>. The rest, bugs, will sort themselves out when the plants are outside, as mentioned they are great hunters. <br /><br />For the <b>soil</b> I used one part peat moss and one part perlite. Peat moss is by itself has very little to no nutrients the plant can use while having amazing water retention due to the shredded sphagnum moss inside. <b>Warning,</b> sphagnum moss is horrible at absorbing water when it is already dry as aposed to humid or damp! However, by itself peat moss will compact and become hard so it needs something to give it structure. For that I have used perlite which makes the soil fluffy and not retain water well, or in other words provides drainage. The down side of this is that is not easy to work with and apparently toxic to breathe. There are a couple of alternatives I have been wanting to try like coconut husks. <br /><br />In this case <b>water</b> will be classified as humidity in the air or in the soil. It is important to understand that moisture in the soil is different from mud. In wet highlands, the ground would be fibrious and fluffy meaning that roots have access to water but also to air. There are two things we do to simulate humidity. The first, is to put sphagnum moss on top of the soil to cover it. The moss itself holds moisture but as it covers the ground it helps the ground retain moisture as well. The second is that I like to have them stand in a deeper dish and a little bit of water. The bottom of the dish will have some aquarium gravel in it and the pot is less than 10% in the water, really not deep! This allows the soil to constantly absrobe moisture without the roots standing in water. The <b>roots should never be submerged in water but should always have humidity</b> around them. ",

With distilled and rain water I have noticed that the water will turn a black or brown color and by the end of the year there were red little worms living in it. Not pleasant. With well water I usually have a lot of algea grow in, which does not harm the Sarracenia while also absorbing nutrients in the water. Algea and Sarracenias seem to have a symbiotic relationship in this case. The water will not be harmful to you or the plant, the water will not be smelly, and it is easy to clean with simple rinse and dollar-store strainer. I will note that I live in North America meaning that untreated well water is more or less exactly the water these plants are used to, so it makes sense to me that they grow well in it.<br /><br /><b>Light</b> is an easy one if you can put the plants outside in the summer. They need a fair amount of sunlight, I have had them in places where they would get a good 12 hours of direct sunlight in 30 C weather and did not show a sign of stress. Slightly shaded light outside will also often do the trick. Remember, these plants live in the North Americas so the climate here is more or less perfect for them. The reason why I cannot grow them outdoors is that the winters where I am get much too cold. As they are dormant during the winter and the summers are warm are perfect where I live I do not keep them indoors much. I would imagine you would need strong lights.<br /><br /><b>Dormancy</b> for these plants would happen around november, giving them until about march for dormancy. In this case dormancy means wait until the soil is just slightly moist, trim the leaves off, sprinkle sulfur on top of the soil/moss to avoid mold, and put them in a fridge. Since the plant is dormant, it will not grow or photosynthesize so it does not need its leaves but it also cannot be completely dry. The dormancy period lasts 3 to 4 months and after that the plants can be taken out again. Having the plants at about 3C in the fridge seems to be cold enough that it simulates winter for these plants, freezing them should be avoided and will likely kill them.",

This nects is meant to attract insects to the opening of the pitcher, I have noticed that flies will crawl all over the plant and I suspect that the whole plant is sweet to alure insects. Once they insect notices the nectar they generally attempt to eat it without falling into the hole. The underside of the part of the leaf that covers the opening, has many little hairs that the insects cannot hold onto. This design makes the nectar uncomfortable for the flies to reach from the open end, wheres the underside of the leaf is not a place they can stand. Once they try, the tumble into the plant pitcher. Once the bug falls inside the pitcher, thye have great difficulty getting out which is for different reasons depending on which subspcies. However, the nectar around the brim and the little hairs are generally how these plants catch their prey. Additionally, flies are attracted to the smell of other dead flies so the plants only attracts more insects both with more leaves that provide a sweet aroma as well as the stench of decaying insects. Generally, I don't notice a smell because the plants are really good at absorbing the nutrients.<br /><br />I read it somewhere, but I have also witnessed that spiders like to make webs on these plants as it attracts a lot of insects, often inevitably leading to the spider falling into the plant.",

When the pitcher opens up, it is initially empty and the inside is also lined with a similar hair that it uses the catch the bug. When the unsuspecting insect falls in it will try to crawl or fly out leading to it rubbing against the hairs lining the inside of the pitcher. Rubbing the leaves causes the plant to produce what is effectively a weak acid to digest the insect. The more the insect struggles the more acid the plant releases. The acid is produced when the hairs are stimulated and stopts shortly after. Once the plant catches more bugs, they will fall on top of the bugs that are already being digested, causing more digestive fluid to run down the pitcher and on top of the bugs below. The pitcher is also long and narrow, designed to squeeze the insects inside to cause more digestive fluid production. <br /><br />The <b>Sarracenia Purpurea</b>, on the other hand, does not cover the top part of the pitcher deliberately to catch rain water. The pitchers themselves are also much shorter and wider, to support the weight of the water and to have more capacity to store it. When the insect falls into the pitcher, it will be trapped in the water. The walls of the pitchers are also made so the insects have trouble climbing them and to absorbe nutrients. Once the insect dies and decays, the plant will absorbe the nutrients from the water.
