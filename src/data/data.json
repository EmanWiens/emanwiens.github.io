This chip can be embedded or something more general purpose. Examples of embedded are <i>Arduino</i> and the <i>Raspberry Pi Pico</i>. These do not have an operating system and will instead execute some code upon startup. On the other hand a general purpose computer would have an operating system as well as all the things around it. This means that we can run a script on startup, but we can also do more advanced things like running multiple software and installing frameworks. Examples of general purpose computers to use for this would be Raspberry Pi zero and up. In this trial I will use what is available to me and use the Raspberry Pi 3B+ as I have one lying around. <br /><br />The second component we need is a <b>motor control board</b>. There are a couple of reasons this is a requirement. First, the motor is likely running on a much higher voltage and current than the computer so we cannot connect a motor directly to the computer. Second, the direction of spin on the motor alternates with the current. Meaning, there is no real + or - on an electric motor but rather it will spin in different directions based on which direction the power is connected. Fun fact, if you use an external source to spin the motor it will generate electricity. The motor controller allows for the current to be switched either way. The compute module will then communicate commands to the motor controller  using <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pulse-width-modulation-pwm/\">Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</a> to control the motor speed and direction.<br /><br />The <b>motors</b> are likely just going to be brushed motors. In my case I will start with using an existing RC car so I can skip the motor gearbox and steering for now. <br /><br />The <b>power source</b> will need to be sufficient for the whole system. In my case I will use a separate power source for the compute module and the motors, this may change in later revisions.",

Please see the latest <a href=\"https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">gpiozero documentation</a> and to get the pinout of your Pi user the <code>pinout</code> command.<br /><br />We will be using the <a href=\"https://python-evdev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">evdev</a> library for reading user inputs, in this case the bluetooth controller.<br /><br />Lines 11 and 12 are setting up the pins that will be used for the motors, see how to use <a href=\"https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_output.html#motor\">Motor()</a>.<br /><br />Lines 14 to 21 are mapping the buttons from the controller to variables. These were obtained by using <code>cat /dev/input/your_input_device</code> on Linux, which simply listens to the input channel and displays it on the screen. For example, when you press a on the controller the input read by the computer is 304. This is a unique value that will allow us to determine what button is pressed.<br /><br />The way we know a button is pressed is by setting up an event listener for the controller, see line 87. If we are able to successfully create an event listener, then we listen, see line 24.<br /><br />Line 26 checks what type of event, since the controller filters the events by type of button. Specifically, this statement filter for the ABXY buttons on the controller, the other events including triggers and joysticks are handled after line 42.<br /><br />The button press events are handled on lines 29 to 41. The button press is a boolean event meaning the button is pressed or not.<br /><br />The trigger, on the other hand, allows for values from 0 to 1023. On line 47 we check for the right trigger (line 54 for left trigger), then we take the read value and normalize it on line 48 to make it a value between 0 and 1. Then we can use the PWM, which is already packaged into the Motor() class and allows us to set a speed between 0 and 1, where 1 is the max speed of the motors.<br /><br />Lines 62 to 70 checks if the user is using the controller d-pad to drive. The d-pad is also like a button so it will also be a motors on or off style.<br /><br />Lastly, we read the joystick values on lines 74 to 83. As you can see on line 75, the joystick has a values between 65535 in total. That means that half is for -x and the other half is for +x, same is true for y. In this case we are only reading the y value to go forwards or backwards. On lines 78 to 83 we apply the speed values from the joystick.",

The documentation for this board is not great, the best I can find is this blury image on <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251801663442954.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt\">AliExpress.us</a>. The main idea of how these work is the same, with a couple of differences. <br /><br />The <b>differences</b> are V+ and CT. This board is powered by the power source conneted to it. So, <i><b>V+ is a 5v output</b></i> to power external devices... I found that one out the hard way. According to <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251801663442954.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt\">AliExpress.us</a>, CT is \"the drive current\" and the usage is \"<code>CT Output Voltage(V)=Current(A) x 0.155</code>\" to \"do current-limiting processing\". It seems that figuring out what CT is will need some investigating.<br /><br />Otherwise, everything else is similar as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07GC26TVK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">L298N Module H Bridge Driver</a>, IN1 and IN2 are the PWM controllers for A and B output channels, respectively. And, EN enables each channel. GND is ground as always.<br /><br />Since we are using a small compute board we can use the DBH-1A V+ output to power our Raspberry Pi Pico W through the <a href=\"https://penguintutor.com/electronics/pico-power\">VSYS pin</a>, <b>to clean up the wiring</b>. This means that we will not have to have two power sources, one for the computer and one for the motors, like we did in Iteration 1. Note, the Raspberry Pi Pico W can run on a range of 1.8V - 5.5V, since I am using two 18650 batteries in parallel, I could connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W directly to the power source.",

As such, I will say that in the next iterations I will either revert to a Raspberry Pi with an operating system or switch to a stronger signal since that is already the plan. This was also just an excuse to work with the Pico W, and they are really fun and absolutely perfect for embedded applications.<br /><br />What you cannot see in this picture is the on off switch neatly tucked underneath the motor control board, easily accessible from the bottom hatch.

After some investigation, we noticed that the motor and motor controller are still fully operational, but the batteries are all done.

The <b>environment</b> these plants are adapted to live in are bogs and wet grasslands. These environments are generally not well shaded due to larger plants' roots suffocating in the water which means <i>near constant direct </i><b>sunlight</b>. Additionally, the water in the environment is usually <b>nutrient poor</b>. So, basically this plant has two of the three ingredients it needs to survive, the third being nutrients to grow.<br/><br/>Due to the lack of nutrients the plants adapted to catch insects. Additionally, these plants have gotten really good at absorbing any nutrients that land on them, so you are not actually allowed to touch them or risk chemical burns wherever you touch the plant. When I report them I usually make sure to keep my hands wet to dilute anything that might be on my hands. It also helps to mist them with water.<br /><br />With regards to <b>climate</b>, these plants live in the warmer parts of the North Americas but still experience a winter dormancy period. During the colder seasons, the leaves (the pitchers) will start to brown and die. Once the frost hits all the leaves will die and all that will be left are the roots. The roots, or rather the rhizome, survives the winter and starts growing more leaves, and sometimes flowers, in the springtime.",

The rest, bugs, will sort themselves out when the plants are outside, as mentioned they are great hunters. <br /><br />For the <b>soil</b> I used one part peat moss and one part perlite. Peat moss by itself has very little to no nutrients the plant can use while having amazing water retention due to the shredded sphagnum moss inside. <b>Warning,</b> sphagnum moss is horrible at absorbing water when it is already dry as opposed to humid or damp! However, by itself peat moss will compact and become hard so it needs something to give it structure. For that I have used perlite which makes the soil fluffy and does not retain water well, or in other words provides drainage. The down side of this is that it is not easy to work with and apparently toxic to breathe. There are a couple of alternatives I have been wanting to try like coconut husks. <br /><br />In this case <b>water</b> will be classified as humidity in the air or in the soil. It is important to understand that moisture in the soil is different from mud. In wet highlands, the ground would be fibrous and fluffy meaning that roots have access to water but also to air. There are two things we do to simulate humidity. The first is to put sphagnum moss on top of the soil to cover it. The moss itself holds moisture but as it covers the ground it helps the ground retain moisture as well. The second is that I like to have them stand in a deeper dish and a little bit of water. The bottom of the dish will have some aquarium gravel in it and the pot is less than 10% in the water, really not deep! This allows the soil to constantly absorb moisture without the roots standing in water. The <b>roots should never be submerged in water but should always have humidity</b> around them. ",

With distilled and rain water I have noticed that the water will turn a black or brown colour and by the end of the year there were red little worms living in it. Not pleasant. With well water I usually have a lot of algae growing in, which does not harm the Sarracenia while also absorbing nutrients in the water. Algae and Sarracenias seem to have a symbiotic relationship in this case. The water will not be harmful to you or the plant, the water will not be smelly, and it is easy to clean with simple rinse and dollar-store strainer. I will note that I live in North America meaning that untreated well water is more or less exactly the water these plants are used to, so it makes sense to me that they grow well in it.<br /><br /><b>Light</b> is an easy one if you can put the plants outside in the summer. They need a fair amount of sunlight, I have had them in places where they would get a good 12 hours of direct sunlight in 30 C weather and did not show a sign of stress. Slightly shaded light outside will also often do the trick. Remember, these plants live in the North Americas so the climate here is more or less perfect for them. The reason why I cannot grow them outdoors is that the winters where I am get much too cold. As they are dormant during the winter and the summers are perfect where I live, I do not keep them indoors much. I would imagine you would need strong lights.<br /><br /><b>Dormancy</b> for these plants would happen around november, giving them until about march for dormancy. In this case dormancy means wait until the soil is just slightly moist, trim the leaves off, sprinkle sulphur on top of the soil/moss to avoid mold, and put them in a fridge. Since the plant is dormant, it will not grow or photosynthesize so it does not need its leaves but it also cannot be completely dry. The dormancy period lasts 3 to 4 months and after that the plants can be taken out again. Having the plants at about 3C in the fridge seems to be cold enough that it simulates winter for these plants, freezing them should be avoided and will likely kill them.",

I have noticed that flies will crawl all over the plant and I suspect that the whole plant is sweet to lure insects. Once they insect notices the nectar they generally attempt to eat it without falling into the hole. The underside of the part of the leaf that covers the opening, has many little hairs that the insects cannot hold onto. This design makes the nectar uncomfortable for the flies to reach from the open end, whereas the underside of the leaf is not a place they can stand. Once they try, the tumble into the plant pitcher. Once the bug falls inside the pitcher, they have great difficulty getting out which is for different reasons depending on which subspecies. However, the nectar around the brim and the little hairs are generally how these plants catch their prey. Additionally, flies are attracted to the smell of other dead flies so the plants only attracts more insects both with more leaves that provide a sweet aroma as well as the stench of decaying insects.

When the pitcher opens up, it is initially empty and the inside is also lined with a similar hair that it uses to catch the bug. When the unsuspecting insect falls in it will try to crawl or fly out leading to it rubbing against the hairs lining the inside of the pitcher. Rubbing the leaves causes the plant to produce what is effectively a weak acid to digest the insect. The more the insect struggles the more acid the plant releases. The acid is produced when the hairs are stimulated and stops shortly after. Once the plant catches more bugs, they will fall on top of the bugs that are already being digested, causing more digestive fluid to run down the pitcher and on top of the bugs below. The pitcher is also long and narrow, designed to squeeze the insects inside to cause more digestive fluid production. <br /><br />The <b>Sarracenia Purpurea</b>, on the other hand, does not cover the top part of the pitcher deliberately to catch rain water. The pitchers themselves are also much shorter and wider, to support the weight of the water and to have more capacity to store it. When the insect falls into the pitcher, it will be trapped in the water. The walls of the pitchers are also made so the insects have trouble climbing them and to absorb nutrients. Once the insect dies and decays, the plant will absorb the nutrients from the water. When more insects fall in, they struggle and stir up the water with all the bits of decaying insects causing the mixture to swirl around which helps the plant absorb it even more.",

Since LEDs are so much more efficient and do not produce nearly as much heat as incandescent light bulbs, they are preferred. For reference, a standard incandescent light will use 60 Watts per hour, whereas the same lamp but LED will use 5 Watts per hour. That means that the cost of powering the incandescent light for <i>one hour</i> can power the same LED light for <i>12 hours</i>! Plants do need heat, but this allows for there to be other sources of heat and it makes it easier to control the temperature in general. I have used regular incandescent lights as heat lamps before, in certain cases it really works well.<br /><br /><b>White light LEDs</b> have different amounts of colours in the spectrum as seen in the image provided by <a href=\"https://www.softlights.org/chapter-11-color-temperature/\">softlights.org</a>. Since they are likely a blue LED with a coating, the way the light colours can be controlled through what is known as Kelvin or warmth of light. The lower ends like 2700K white light has little blue light whereas the higher 5000K has a lot of blue light.

Most if the higher energy UV rays, including UV-C and UV-B, are filtered out by the atmosphere leaving mostly UV-A with a little UV-B rays. According to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.00541/full\">Laura Llorens et al. in Editorial: Ultraviolet Radiation: Friend or Foe for Plants?</a>, UV-A and UV-B light is important for certain developments in plants. UV light can be harmful in large doses but plants have adapted to these rays, and they should not be cosnidered as a regulatory stiumulus rather than a stressor. Even UV within the range of 385 nm increased plant growth. <a href=\"https://hydrobuilder.com/learn/uv-light-for-plants/\">Hydrobuilder.com</a> argues that they increase resitance to disease due to the ability to create a larger variety of proteins. I am not a chemist, but this makes sense to me as there is always the <a href=\"https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Book%3A_Structure_and_Reactivity_in_Organic_Biological_and_Inorganic_Chemistry_(Schaller)/IV%3A__Reactivity_in_Organic_Biological_and_Inorganic_Chemistry_2/01%3A_Reaction_Kinetics/1.03%3A_Activation_Barriers\">activation energy</a> to a chemical reaction, or in other words the amount of energy required to start a reaction. <br /><br />The UV index will also change throughout the year just as the infrared (heat) does. There is chart for NYC UV index, but it provides a good reference to understanding that UV index changes intensity throughout the year and what the average UV index in a day looks like. Right now, I am interested in the shape of the slope as well.",

Instead of it meaning, “Go to the nearest plant store or supermarket and buy some general purpose fertiliser.” What it actually means is that the plant needs minerals. Much like your body needs certain minerals for growth and maintenance, plants do as well. So really, when talking about fertiliser we are talking about minerals that the plants need to grow. ",

These minerals are then used by the plants to grow. For example, onions need sulphur in the soil and in return they <a href=\"http://files-do-not-link.udc.edu/docs/causes/online/Onions%209.pdf\">store sulphur in them</a>. Another example is cucumbers, which <a href=\"https://libanswers.nybg.org/faq/223327#:~:text=Cucumbers%20need%20moderate%20nitrogen%20and,4%2D6)%20is%20good.\">need potassium in the soil to grow</a> and guess what’s <a href=\"https://ingenaes.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/ING-Info-Sheet-2018_05-Cucumber-nutritional-value-Kowalewska.pdf\">inside cucumbers, potassium</a>, among many other minerals. Coincidentally, from plants is where we get a lot of our minerals, since we <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Mental-Health-ea7d9ba33d7e413cb5a7ac7096ab66bc?pvs=21\">cannot digest dirt</a>. <br /><br />The problem is that when we are farming plants in a small-ish area and they use up the same minerals, at some point certain minerals will deplete and there are two major ways that we can combat this. The first and easiest, plant other plants in that area. Different plants need different minerals so while one plant may struggle in a particular spot, another plant may thrive. And the second, of course, being that we retrieve those minerals from somewhere and put them in the ground ourselves. However, those minerals are often in some form that plants can absorb and then we call it fertiliser.",

The idea is that you place a target in a random location on the screen, which is not drawn, then find the closest point of the path already travelled and take a step into the direction of the random point.

It's interesting that even though it takes a random step, it still finds the goal even in really tough spots.

                            "text": "ACO is a meta-heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems, which is a fancy way of saying routing problems. The most basic instance of a routing problem is the famous <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/167517\">\"Travelling-salesman problem\" introduced by Merrill M. Flood in 1955</a>. The basic idea is for a single salesman to visit every city with the shortest possible distance. The reason this is a combinatorial problem is because for n cities there are n! different solutions. For example, if there are 10 cities then there are 3628800 different combinations of possible routes, where one route will be the shortest. Since finding the optimal solution when n is large is not possible within a reasonable amount of time, better methods need to be developed. In ACO, the variation is that there are many ants and they make choices based on probability which is based on the distance. Meaning, a given ant can see all the cities and each city will have a probability of being visited based on the distance. So, the closest will have the highest probability and the furthest the least. Additionally, when an ant travels down a path it lays pheromones which can be seen by other ants. In which case the probability will be based on both the distance and the pheromone strength. I implemented this as a visual representation to see how the algorithm works based on a tutorial by <a href=\"https://bsantosa.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/aco-tutorial-english2.pdf\">Budi Santosa (2015)</a>.

Ridge regression takes the error into account and tries to minimise error by giving points a weight that indicates how much this point should contribute to the model. For example, an outlier is not desirable so giving it a small weight means that it will be less likely to make the model incorrect. Additionally, once you can also use more advanced methods like nonlinear solutions.

Each 'root' is made up of several blades of grass and each blade of grass is made up of several particles. The grass can grow and be mowed. I also worked on making it sway in the wind which was a challenge. <br /><br />I have since learned more about optimising code and different strategies that I could have used to accomplish similar things, but I enjoyed writing it. When I wrote this program I didn't know that this is technically a particle system, I just had the idea and wanted to try it.",
