The drill is in decent shape but it is old. We tried it and it did not work, and initially we thought we would just scrap it for parts. Afterall, there is large eletric motor, a motor controller, and a battery and if even 1 of those works then the $5 invenestment my brother made was worth it. After some investigation, we noticed that the motor and motor controller are still fully operational, but the batteries are all done. When I saw the batteries are done, I mean 0 volts and <i>visibly oxidized</i>.",
