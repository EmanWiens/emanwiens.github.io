The drill is in decent shape but it is old. We tried it and it did not work, and initially we thought we would just scrap it for parts. Afterall, there is large eletric motor, a motor controller, and a battery and if even 1 of those works then the $5 invenestment my brother made was worth it. After some investigation, we noticed that the motor and motor controller are still fully operational, but the batteries are all done. When I saw the batteries are done, I mean 0 volts and <i>visibly oxidized</i>.",

The image is the cross section of the drill with the parts annotated. The first component is the <b>Chuck</b>, which is used to fasten the drill bits to the motor. The second component is the <b>Gearbox</b>, basically including gears that allow for more torque or more speed controlled by the switch at the top. Third, the <b>Electric Motor</b>, a device that converts electricity into mechanical rotation. The fourth component is a <b>Motor Controller</b>, which allows the user to set different speeds for the motor buy allowing a higher or lower voltage into the motor. Note, a general rule of thumb is that a higher voltage will provide higher speed speed whereas more amperage will provide more torque. The motor controller is likely the most technical part of all of this but there are really just a couple of mosfets, switches, diodes, and a spring. And lastly, the <b>Battery</b> that powers the device, in this case they appear to be Nickel–cadmium batteries.",

Additionally, the water in the environment is usually nutrient poor. So, basically this plant has two of the three ingredients it needs to survive, the third being nutrients to grow. <br/><br/>Due the the lack of nutrients the plants adapted to catch insects. Additionally, these plants have gotten really good at absorbing any nutrients that land on them, so you are not actually allowed to touch them or risk chemical burns wherever you touched the plant.
