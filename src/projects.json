The drill is in decent shape but it is old. We tried it and it did not work, and initially we thought we would just scrap it for parts. Afterall, there is large eletric motor, a motor controller, and a battery and if even 1 of those works then the $5 invenestment my brother made was worth it. After some investigation, we noticed that the motor and motor controller are still fully operational, but the batteries are all done. When I saw the batteries are done, I mean 0 volts and oxidizing.",

The printer itself is of good quality and for a few dollars it was worth the money. Instead of trying to find some fancy printer, I decided to try to see if I can find a workaround for this. And since I like learning new things, especially related to tech, that is exactly what I did.
