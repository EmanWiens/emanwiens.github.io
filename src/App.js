                    <p>I always wanted to make a gravity simulation, where the stellar bodies actually move around based on gravity. I've also always wanted to do something with Javascript. So, I combined the two and wrote this gravity simulation in Javascript. There are a wide variety of calculations that I had to use and it was really not as simple as I thought it would be. However, it was really fun to do and I really enjoy watching it go. Currently, is has the sun and the first 4 planets in our solar system.<a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Grav_2D">Github</a>.</p>

                    <hr></hr>
                    <p>Rapid Exploring Random Trees is a method of exploring a terrain. The idea is that you place a target in a random location on the screen, which is not drawn, then find the closest point of the path already travelled and take a step into the direction of the random point. Continue this until you reach the goal. I learned about this a while back in a course and have now re-implemented it mostly for amusement, I just love watching it explore. It's interesting that even though it takes a random step, it still finds the goal even in really tough spots. See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Rapidly_Exploring_Random_Trees">Github</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Fall 2021, Personal Project</h2>
                    <hr></hr>
                    <p>ACO is a meta-heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems, which is a fancy way of saying routing problem. The most basic instance of a routing problem is the famous <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/167517">"Travelling-salesman problem" introduced by Merrill M. Flood in 1955</a>. The basic idea is for a single salesman to visit every city with the shortest possible distance. The reason this is a combinatorial problem is because for n cities there are n! different solutions. For example, if there are 10 cities then there are 3628800 different combinations of possible routes, where one route will be the shortest. Since finding the optimal solution when n is large is not possible within a reasonable amount of time, better methods need to be developed. In ACO, the variation is that there are many ants and they make choices based on probability which is based on the distance. Meaning, a given ant can see all the cities and each city will have a probability of being visited based on the distance. So, the closest will have the highest probability and the furthest the least. Additionally, when an ant travels down a path is lays pheromones which can be seen by other ants. In which case the probability will be based on both the distance and the pheromone strength. I implemented this as a visual reprentation to see how the algorithm works based on a tutorial by <a href="https://bsantosa.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/aco-tutorial-english2.pdf">Budi Santosa (2015)</a>.

                    <hr></hr>
                    <p>Least square regression simply tries to minimize the distance to all points. Ridge regression takes the error into account and tries to minimize error by giving points a weight that indicates how much this point should contribute to the model. For example, an outlier is not desirable so giving it a small weight means that it will be less likely to make the model incorrect. Additionally, once you can also use more advanced methods like nonlinear solutions. For now, I implemented the simplest version of the algorithm. <br /><br />See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Least_Squares_Regression" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

                    <p> In my last year I did an honours project focusing on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information processing. This started by first looking into what a Quantum Processor is and why it is different and such a hot topic. Once I learned more about how to manage state and the underlying math behind it, I worked on writing simple quantum algorithms on IBM Q. Throughout this project I made us of technologies such as <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a> and <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/">IBM Q Experience</a>.

                        I have since learned more about optimizing code and different strategies that I could have used to accomplish similar things, but I enjoyed writing it.

        <p>June 10, 2023: Lately, I have been learning more about <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#">CUDA programming</a> which is a c-like programming language meant to be run on a Nvidia graphics card. Learning more about CUDA has been something I have been interested in a while as I am very interested in parallel and distributed computing. In terms of parallel programming this is an amazingly strong resource to have. Even consumer level GPUs have a LOT of memory and CUDA cores that range in the thousands or even ten thousands. These cards are capabale of running a lot of parallel calculations making them excellent for solving many different types of mathematical problems. I am currently learning more about how the memory model of the cards work which is divided into global and shared memory. The computation is divided into what are called blocks and shared memory on a given block is only accessible on that block, whereas global memory is accessible to all blocks.</p>

The RC tank project from below has been published there. Additionally, I have been interested in making visualizations of machine learning algorithms. I noticed that there are some that are just conceptually tough to grasp, but once I saw what it is that they do it was really easy to determine what they are doing. You can see them on the Notion.so page as well as on my <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">projects page</a>.

There has been a lot of learning to do for that project. First, I connected a <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076MPL9P1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">Raspberry PI camera module</a> for a <a href="https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes2.html#web-streaming" target="_blank">live feed</a>.

Doing so required me to get a basic understanding of how batteries work such as putting them in <a href="https://www.power-sonic.com/blog/how-to-connect-batteries-in-series-and-parallel/" target="_blank">parallel or in series</a>. I ran into an issue when I connected the tank motors to the Raspberry PI as it was not getting enough power to the motors. I think I used wires that cannot carry the right amount of amps. If I can get that working I have been looking into <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B083DMWHBL/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_1?smid=A30Y6WWS77DGEW&psc=1" target="_blank">radio transceivers</a> as a potential alternative to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth controller, like an <a href="https://howchoo.com/pi/xbox-controller-raspberry-pi" target="_blank">Xbox One controller</a>, and live video feed.

In this assignment we are to conduct an experiment to test which is faster for tablet input, the index finger or the thumb. The measurement used to determine which has higher throughput is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" target="_blank">Fitts's law</a>. Simply put, this is a measure that is said to be able to predict how fast a person can move from one target to another with a disance A and a target of size W. Aside from learning what Fitts's law is, I also learned about react native which is the environment my partner and I used to implement this experiment. It has been amazing learning the ins and outs of react native even though I feel I have only scratched the surface. Further, I learned that the index finger has higher throughput than the thumb on tablets through our experiment.</p>

                <p>16 Feb, 2021: I have learned a couple things this week but I am a bit behind during this busy season, so I am hoping that I can catch up over this week as I have the reading week break. To discuss one thing, for one of my courses I had to pick a teaching technology and write about how it works from the student and the teacher perspectives. The technology I chose to explore was <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html" target="_blank">Data Structure Visualizations</a> because I love Visualizations of complex data structures and algorithms. From the student perspective, I have used this to get a better image of how some algorithms work and have used these kinds of tools as a way to work through what I think the algorithm will do in a given situation with a given input. For the teachers, the creator Dr. David Gallas made the code available to be extended. I implemented a simple sorting algorithm to understand the framework he has created, which I learned runs almost entirely on JS. As a person with limited JS experience, it was amazing to program JS in an environment that has visual feedback for the algorithms being implemented as I am a visual thinker. This was not in the report I wrote for the course but it feels worth discussing here. </p>

                <p>7 Feb, 2021: This week I read a paper about <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221192597_A_Particle_Swarm_Optimization-Based_Heuristic_for_Scheduling_Workflow_Applications_in_Cloud_Computing_Environments" target="_blank">Particle swarm optimization</a>. The concept is to have many particles that are given properties of the problem to solve and each one goes off on their own to attempt to solve the problem. A given particle compares how well it did with its own best attempt as well as the global best attempt. The context of this article was cloud computing resources and attempting to optimize some aspect of it, like least possible execution time. I tried to understand all the math but some of it went over my head, but I am interested to do some more reading. This idea came from ants, since they each perform their own tasks yet are known to be very efficient creatures. According to the paper, this type of optimization algorithm is accurate yet efficient at finding solutions and has been applied to solving other NP-Hard problems.</p>

                <p>31 Jan, 2021 (edited: 7 Feb, 2021): I recently got a new amp as a gift! I love how it sounds. I noticed that because my amp was broken and I was not able to play properly, it deterred me from wanting to learn new songs since they always sounded bad when I played them on my amp. Now that I have a new amp, I noticed how bad the state of my old amp was and I am noticing that I am wanting to play again and that I want to learn more about music. <br /><br /> 
                    
                Over the years I have taught myself to play the guitar. Since I learned it myself, I have noticed that my learning does not always follow a structure and I learn things out of order. Or, as with chords, I learned them so long ago and have forgotten many of them since my style is rock and metal music which do not often use chords. <br /><br /> 
                    
                Yesterday was the first time that I jammed with a friend, he plays drums. We played a few songs that we both like, we are both fans of System of a down, and though it requires more practice I think we sounded good. One thing that I started reading into more in the last few days are scales. I had heard of scales in music many times before and had some idea of what they are but never learned what they are formally and what they are for guitar. My basic understanding is that there are preset combinations of strings and frets (i.e. the vertical bars on the neck of the guitar) that sound nice and I think scales are also used to make chords. I hope that learning scales will give me the ability to improvise more when playing, which I notice is not something that I am particularly good at yet.</p>

                <p>20 Jan, 2021: I have great interest in machine learning and took a few courses that taught me more about them. I really loved learning the concepts but have since forgotten some of the things that I have learned. As I was refreshing my knowledge I had the sudden urge to program <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ridge-regression-for-better-usage-2f19b3a202db" target="_blank">Ridge Regression</a> on a live setting where the user can add points and see how well the line fits them. I planned to do Ridge regression but for now only Linear Regression is implemented. The thing that is missing is the error. I have made the <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Ridge_Regression" target="_blank">code</a> I wrote public, it's not the cleanest but it demonstrates some of the key points of the model.</p>

                <p>8 Jan, 2021: I have attempted using Unity before for making games a year or so ago but the first time I touched it I did not get far. For this reason, I stopped the project for the time and started some tutorials. A friend of mine sent me the <a href="https://studentgamedev.blogspot.com/2013/08/unity-voxel-tutorial-part-1-generating.html" target="_blank">Unity Voxel Tutorial</a>. The tutorial goes over how to generate a gameobjects mesh and how to shape it after. For example, after creating 2D terrain, it used ray tracing to make caves by casting a line through the map. This was a really fun tutorial to follow and very informative. Since then, I have started a project with another friend in unity. There has been good progress in the project and my friend is very patient as I take longer on simple tasks than he does.</p>

                <p>6 Jan, 2021: For one of my courses I had to implement topic modelling using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gensim/" target="_blank">Gensim</a> library. There is a generative statistical model called Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The project was based on a paper called <a href="https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/sthomas/data/Barua_2012_EMSE.pdf" target="_blank">What are developers talking about? An analysis of topics and trends in Stack Overflow</a>. As the title suggests, the point of the article is to analyze what topics developers are talking about and how those trends change over the time spanning from July 2008 to September 2010, which involved around 3.5 million posts. They were able to find significant trends. In our project we were only able to sample 50,000 posts from 3 million ranging from February 2020 to September 2020. However, insignificant, the results we found were interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed learning to use this new modelling tool. Due to this being made for a course, I am not sure if I am allowed to make this code public. Given this limitation, I may write a similar code again and fix the things I did not like the first time and republish the code. This might be a large undertaking and I am currently working on other projects which limits my time. I will, however, be discussing my other projects in later blog entries. </p>

                <p>5 Jan, 2021 (edited: 7, Feb 2021): First entry. I am excited to start a blog. I have wanted to start a blog for some time where I can discuss the projects I have worked on in the past and present, as well as future projects that I hope to tackle. Given the nature of some of my projects, there might be limited things I can discuss, but I still look forward to discussing what I can. Further, I may also discuss various things about new things that are being introduced in the computer science world. Lastly, I will discuss things that I have learned on my own or for other reasons like work or school. Since I have various interests including plants, animals, playing guitar, computers and gaming, amongst other things that strike my interest.</p>
