            <h1>Emanuel Wiens</h1>
            <HR>
            <p> Grad Student at the University of Manitoba.<br />
                Bachelor of Computer Science Honours 2020.<br />
                </p>

            <h3>Programming languages</h3>
            <p>I have been programming since about 2011 and have since worked extensively with C#, Java, Assembly, C/C++, HTML and CSS, and Python. I have dabbled with other languages such as Ruby, SQL, and Javascript. </p>

            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>Through my various projects for school, work, and personal projects I have become familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio, Ubuntu Linux, Robotics, ROS (Robot Operating System), Android studio, Raspberry Pi, Raspbian, Processing, Godot Game Engine, and the Bash terminal.</p>


            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I have a natural curiosity and always loved learning, so University and other such institutions that allow for exploration and research are places that I feel right at home. I have always had an interest in simulations and games. However, many of the games I start making often turn into simulations as I am too lazy to test my games and have, in the past, programmed simple A.I.s to perform tasks for testing. Much of the code that I wrote in the past has been lost due to lack of version control :( ever since learning Git I have not had such a problem. Feel free to browse my <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/emanuel-w-529474178" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>. I have also started documenting some of my projects better and <a href="https://emanuelwiens.notion.site/Published-Pages-c2c9a752f63a4078adb719daeb959b64" target="_blank">publishing</a> them. <br /><br />
        
            To showcase my interests I created a blog where I discuss other interests I have and as I research them I might write short entries of what I found interesting. An interest I have had since I was young is nature. As such, I have always enjoyed hiking in the woods, camping or fishing. Another hobby that keeps me busy are house plants and gardening. Since gardening is not possible in the winter months, I have some house plants to keep the hobby going. Additionally, I have taught myself to play the guitar and have played for many years. Lately, I have been interested in learning to play the piano, but it is slow-going. Lastly, an interest of mine is astronautics! There is so much to explore in space and we have only scratched the surface.</p>
