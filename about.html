            <h3>About me</h3>
                <p> I have a natural curiosity and always loved learning, so University and other such institutions that allow for exploration and  research are places that I feel right at home. I have always had an interest in simulations and games. However, many of the games I start making often turn into simulations as I am too lazy to test my games and have, in the past, programmed simple AIs to perform tasks, which effectively turns the game into a simulation. Much of the code that I wrote in the past has been lost due to lack of version control :( ever since learning git I have not had such a problem. Feel free to browse my <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/emanuel-w-529474178" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.</p><br /><br /> 
            
                Though programming and the like take up a good chunk of my time, I do have other hobbies and interests! I created a blog where I discuss, mostly computer science things, but there are other interests I have and as I research into them I might write short entries of what I found interesting. I have always had a liking for nature. As such, I have always enjoyed and felt right at home hiking in the woods, camping or fishing. Another hobby that keeps we busy are house plants and gardening. Since gardening is not possible in the winter months, I have some house plants to keep the hobby going. I have taught myself to play the guitar and have played for many years. During quaratine I have been playing a lot of guitar and have increased my skills a lot. Lastly, this one is more of an interst than a hobby, but I love space! Space travel is becoming popular and I have read many articles and watched many videos. I hope to be alive in the era where interplanatary travel is commonplace.
