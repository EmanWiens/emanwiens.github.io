Flood in 1955'),". The basic idea is for a single salesman to visit every city with the shortest possible distance. The reason this is a combinatorial problem is because for n cities there are n! different solutions. For example, if there are 10 cities then there are 3628800 different combinations of possible routes, where one route will be the shortest. Since finding the optimal solution when n is large is not possible within a reasonable amount of time, better methods need to be developed. In ACO, the variation is that there are many ants and they make choices based on probability which is based on the distance. Meaning, a given ant can see all the cities and each city will have a probability of being visited based on the distance. So, the closest will have the highest probability and the furthest the least. Additionally, when an ant travels down a path is lays pheromones which can be seen by other ants. In which case the probability will be based on both the distance and the pheromone strength.
