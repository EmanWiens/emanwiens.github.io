Given the nature of certain projects may not be allowed to go into certain details. However, there are many projects that I am proud to show off and there are always some more to add.

                <HR>
                <p> As part of being on the Executive Team for the Computer Science Students' Association we hosted a Game Jam. After all the event planning done by the other members and myself, we managed to make a mini game. This is a three day project that the four of us finished. 
                
                    <br /><br />Game description: Your pig just won first prize at the county fair. The other farmers are angry that you won and start throwing rocks at your pig. The pig is defenseless against getting hit by a rock and will die immediately. Luckly, you are a skilled rock catcher so it is up to you to catch the rocks. While dodging and catching rocks, you find coins on the ground that you can use to buy protection for your pig.<br /><br />See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/FlakySuperpower" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

                <h2>Honours Project, Fall 2019, University Project</h2>
                <HR>
                <p> In my last year I did an honours project focusing on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information processing. This started by first looking into what a Quantum Processor is and why it is different and such a hot topic. Once I learned more about how to manage state and the underlying math behind it, I worked on writing simple quantum alogorithms on IBM Q. Throughout this project I made us of technologies such as Qiskit and IBM Q Experience.

                <h2>Planet Colonizer, Summer 2018, Personal Project</h2>
                <HR>
                <p>This is a personal projects that I took worked on through the summer. It's a simulation that "populates" the planets and its moons. There are calculations based on real population growth and decay, as well as a max population that can be supported on a given planet. And, of course these numbers are based on real statistics. Otherwise, where's the fun? <br /><br /> 
                
                The code is left open for future extensions such as adding limited resources to the planets and having some user controlled aspects of the simulation. As of now it only includes our solar system (not all pictured). Again, the code is made so it's easily extensible so it would not be hard to add a component to procedurally generate more solar systems. So it is possible to have the simulation be as infinite as the real universe.

                <h2>Particle System, Fall 2018, University Project</h2>
                <HR>
                    <p>This is a particle system that I did for an assignment and then later slightly modified. It's a rather simple program, but I it was fun to make. I also like the idea of using small particles to simulate things like smoke and fire.<br /><br />

                    The particles have mass and slightly change color on every collision, which is only noticeable when the program runs for a few seconds.

                <HR>
                    <p>Another personal project that simulates growing grass using particles. This whole program is procedurally generated. Each 'root' is made up of several blades of grass and each blade of grass is made up of several particles. The grass can grow and be mowed. I also worked on making it sway inthe wind which was a challenge. <br /><br />

                    I have since learned more about optimizing code and different strategies that I could have used to accomplish similar things, but I enjoyed writing it. When I wrote this program I didn't know that this is technically a particle system, I just had the idea and wanted to try it.
