                    <h2>Rapid Exploring Random Trees, Fall 2021, Personal Project</h2>
                    <HR>
                    <p>Rapid Exploring Random Trees is a method of exploring a terrain. The idea is that you place a target in a random location on the screen, which is not drawn, then find the closest point of the path already travelled and take a step into the direction of the random point. Continue this until you reach the goal. I learned about this a while back in a course and have now re-implemented it mostly for amusement, I just love watching it explore. It's interesting that even though it takes a random step, it still finds the goal even in really tough spots. See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Rapidly_Exploring_Random_Trees">Github</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Fall 2021, Personal Project</h2>
                    <HR>
                    <p>ACO is a meta-heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems, which is a fancy way of saying routing problem. The most basic instance of a routing problem is the famous <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/167517">"Travelling-salesman problem" introduced by Merrill M. Flood in 1955</a>. The basic idea is for a single salesman to visit every city with the shortest possible distance. The reason this is a combinatorial problem is because for n cities there are n! different solutions. For example, if there are 10 cities then there are 3628800 different combinations of possible routes, where one route will be the shortest. Since finding the optimal solution when n is large is not possible within a reasonable amount of time, better methods need to be developed. In ACO, the variation is that there are many ants and they make choices based on probability which is based on the distance. Meaning, a given ant can see all the cities and each city will have a probability of being visited based on the distance. So, the closest will have the highest probability and the furthest the least. Additionally, when an ant travels down a path is lays pheromones which can be seen by other ants. In which case the probability will be based on both the distance and the pheromone strength. I implemented this as a visual reprentation to see how the algorithm works based on a tutorial by <a href="https://bsantosa.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/aco-tutorial-english2.pdf">Budi Santosa (2015)</a>.

                    <h2>Least square regression, Winter 2021, Personal Project</h2>
                    <HR>
                    <p>Least square regression simply tries to minimize the distance to all points. Ridge regression takes the error into account and tries to minimize error by giving points a weight that indicates how much this point should contribute to the model. For example, an outlier is not desirable so giving it a small weight means that it will be less likely to make the model incorrect. Additionally, once you can also use more advanced methods like nonlinear solutions. For now, I implemented the simplest version of the algorithm. <br /><br />See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Least_Squares_Regression" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

After all the event planning done by the other members and myself, we managed to make a mini game. This is a three day project that the four of us finished.

The pig is defenceless against getting hit by a rock and will die immediately. Luckly, you are a skilled rock catcher so it is up to you to catch the rocks. While dodging and catching rocks, you find coins on the ground that you can use to buy protection for your pig.<br /><br />See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/FlakySuperpower" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

                    <HR>
                    <p> In my last year I did an honours project focusing on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information processing. This started by first looking into what a Quantum Processor is and why it is different and such a hot topic. Once I learned more about how to manage state and the underlying math behind it, I worked on writing simple quantum algorithms on IBM Q. Throughout this project I made us of technologies such as <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a> and <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/">IBM Q Experience</a>.

There are calculations based on real population growth and decay, as well as a max population that can be supported on a given planet. And, of course these numbers are based on real statistics. Otherwise, where's the fun? As of now it only includes our solar system (not all pictured).

                        <p>This is a particle system that I did for an assignment and then later slightly modified. It's a rather simple program, but it was fun to make. I also like the idea of using small particles to simulate things like smoke and fire.<br /><br />
    
                        The particles have mass and slightly change color on every collision, which is only noticeable when the program runs for a few seconds.

                        <p>Another personal project that simulates growing grass using particles. This whole program is procedurally generated. Each 'root' is made up of several blades of grass and each blade of grass is made up of several particles. The grass can grow and be mowed. I also worked on making it sway in the wind which was a challenge. <br /><br />
    
                        I have since learned more about optimizing code and different strategies that I could have used to accomplish similar things, but I enjoyed writing it. When I wrote this program I didn't know that this is technically a particle system, I just had the idea and wanted to try it.
