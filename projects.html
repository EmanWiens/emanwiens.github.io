There were many bumps in the road, but with proper communication and lot of patience we all pulled together as a team to make this entertaining mini game. <br /><br />See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/hackmaster" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

                <p> As part of being on the Executive Team for the Computer Science Students' Association we hosted a Game Jam. After all the event planning done by the other members and myself, we managed to make a mini game. This is a three day project that the four of us finished. 
                
                    <br /><br />Game description: Your pig just won first prize at the county fair. The other farmers are angry that you won and start throwing rocks at your pig. The pig is defenseless against getting hit by a rock and will die immediately. Luckly, you are a skilled rock catcher so it is up to you to catch the rocks. While dodging and catching rocks, you find coins on the ground that you can use to buy protection for your pig.<br /><br />See the code on <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/FlakySuperpower" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

                <HR>
                <p> In my last year I did an honours project focusing on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information processing. This started by first looking into what a Quantum Processor is and why it is different and such a hot topic. Once I learned more about how to manage state and the underlying math behind it, I worked on writing simple quantum alogorithms on IBM Q. Throughout this project I made us of technologies such as Qiskit and IBM Q Experience.

                <HR>
                <p>This is a personal projects that I took worked on through the summer.
                    It's a simulation that "populates" the planets and its moons. There are calculations based on real
                    population growth and decay, as well as a max population that can be supported on a given planet.
                    And, of course these numbers are based on real statistics. Otherwise, where's the fun? <br /><br />

                    The code is left open for future extensions such as adding limited resources to the planets and
                    having some user controlled aspects of the simulation. As of now it only includes our solar system
                    (not all pictured). Again, the code is made so it's easily extensible so it would not be hard to add
                    a component to procedurally generate more solar systems. So it is possible to have the simulation be
                    as infinite as the real universe.

                <HR>
                    <p>Another personal project that simulates growing grass using particles. This whole program is procedurally generated. Each 'root' is made up of several blades of grass and each blade of grass is made up of several particles. The grass can grow and be mowed. I also worked on making it sway inthe wind which was a challenge. <br /><br />

                    I have since learned more about optimizing code and different strategies that I could have used to accomplish similar things, but I enjoyed writing it. When I wrote this program I didn't know that this is technically a particle system, I just had the idea and wanted to try it.

                    <p>This is a particle system that I did for an assignment and then later slightly modified. It's a rather simple program, but I it was fun to make. I also like the idea of using small particles to simulate things like smoke and fire.<br /><br />

                    The particles have mass and slightly change color on every collision, which is only noticeable when the program runs for a few seconds.

                <h2>3D free walk, Fall 2018, University Project</h2>
                <HR>
                    <p>This is a program that I am particularly proud of. I had programmed many 2D animations but nothing in 3D. The reason was that I never knew where to start with it, and it was scary. This was an assignment I had to tackle in class and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.<br /><br />

                    In this program you are able to freely walk in a 3D space and look at some 3D animations. I also added collision detection to prevent the player from being able to walk through walls and exhibits (the floating pictures). The images are given at various sizes, I had to add a short algorithm that scales the images down to an expected size. <br /><br />
