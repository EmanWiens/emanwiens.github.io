            <p>5 Jan, 2020: First entry. I am excited to start a blog. I have wanted to start a blog for some time where I can discuss the projects I have worked on in the past and present, as well as future projects that I hope to tackle. Further, I may also discuss various things about new things that are being introduced in the computer science world. Given the nature of some of my projects, there might be limited things I can discuss, but I still look forward to discussing them. For now, there are projects from the past that I want to discuss and I will spend the next few days discussing those projects. Hopefully, once I am caught up I will be writing about my projects as they happen rather than after the fact.</p>
