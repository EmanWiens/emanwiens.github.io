                <p>8 Jan, 2020: I have attempted using Unity before for making games a year or so ago but the first time I touched it I did not get far. For this reason, I stopped the project for the time and started some tutorials. Unity has a steep learning curve and after doing some tutorials the game engine made more sense. My friend and I started a side project which is still very new and I am not sure how much I can discuss yet this early on. For refernce, the game has a space theme and I hope to be able to discuss it more as we progress with the project.</p>

                <p>6 Jan, 2020: For one of my courses I had to implement topic modelling using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gensim/" target="_blank">Gensim</a> library. There is a generative statistical model called Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The project was based on a paper called <a href="https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/sthomas/data/Barua_2012_EMSE.pdf" target="_blank">What are developers talking about? An analysis of topics and trends in Stack Overflow</a>. As the title suggests, the point of the article is to analyze what topics developers are talking about and how those trends change over the time spanning from July 2008 to September 2010, which involved around 3.5 million posts. They were able to find significant trends. In our project we were only able to sample 50,000 posts from 3 million ranging from February 2020 to September 2020. However, insignificant, the results we found were interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed learning to use this new modelling tool. Due to this being made for a course, I am not sure if I am allowed to make this code public. Given this limitation, I may write a similar code again and fix the things I did not like the first time and republish the code. This might be a large undertaking and I am currently working on other projects which limits my time. I will, however, be discussing my other projects in later blog entries. </p>

                <p>5 Jan, 2020: First entry. I am excited to start a blog. I have wanted to start a blog for some time where I can discuss the projects I have worked on in the past and present, as well as future projects that I hope to tackle. Further, I may also discuss various things about new things that are being introduced in the computer science world. Given the nature of some of my projects, there might be limited things I can discuss, but I still look forward to discussing them. For now, there are projects from the past that I want to discuss and I will spend the next few days discussing those projects. Hopefully, once I am caught up I will be writing about my projects as they happen rather than after the fact.</p>
