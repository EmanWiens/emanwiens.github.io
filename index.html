                <p>Jan 10, 2022: I have been wanting to make a real time strategy game for a little while now but I couldn't decide what I wanted to use to make it. Recentely, a friend recommended <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a>. I decided to do a <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html#overview" target="_blank">tutorial</a> and I found it really intuitive to use! The UI is well designed and provides a lot of transparency in terms of game object hierarchies. I have decided to use this to make a real time strategy game.</p>

                <p>Dec 30, 2021: Over the course of this year I attempted to do more personal projects and document them well. Some went well and some not so much. There are some fun projects that I wanted to publish yet but I have not gotten around to cleaning them up. I started publishing my projects on <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion.so</a> and you can see my <a href="https://emanuelwiens.notion.site/Published-Pages-c2c9a752f63a4078adb719daeb959b64" target="_blank">published pages</a> there. The RC tank project from below has been published there. Additionally, I have been interested in making visualizations of machine learning algorithms. I noticed that there are some that are just conceptually tough to grasp, but once I saw what it is that they do it was really easy to determine what they are doing. You can see them on the Notion.so page as well as on my <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">projects page</a>. Currently I am attempting to see if I can create a simple visualization of Bayesian inference and if it turns out the way I want it to, I will likely publish it or at least talk about it on the projects page.</p>

                <p>Nov 8, 2021: One of the larger projects I have been working on is making my own R.C. car that I can control using my <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</a>. There has been a lot of learning to do for that project. First, I connected a <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B076MPL9P1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">Raspberry PI camera module</a> for a <a href="https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes2.html#web-streaming" target="_blank">live feed</a>. I inadvertently got an infrared camera so I also got the <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07JKJQN4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">night vision module</a> shortly after. Additionally, I had to learn how to use a control board like the <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07GC26TVK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">L298N module</a> to control the motors. Doing so required me to get a basic understanding of how batteries work such as putting them in <a href="https://www.power-sonic.com/blog/how-to-connect-batteries-in-series-and-parallel/" target="_blank">parallel or in series</a>. I ran into an issue when I connected the tank motors to the Raspberry PI as it was not getting enough power to the motors. I think I used wires that cannot carry the right amount of amps. If I can get that working I have been looking into <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B083DMWHBL/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_1?smid=A30Y6WWS77DGEW&psc=1" target="_blank">radio transceivers</a> as a potential alternative to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth controller, like an <a href="https://howchoo.com/pi/xbox-controller-raspberry-pi" target="_blank">Xbox One controller</a>, and live video feed. Currently, I am working on documenting everything that I have done to make a guide on how you can do these things yourself.</p>

                <p>1 Nov, 2021: It's been a while since I updated this page, which is not to say that I have not been working on personal projects. I will take the time to discuss the various projects I worked on soon. For now, I want to say that the last year has been a tough one and I appreciate all the lovely people in my life as we all stood together to face this hardship. </p>

                <p>21 Feb, 2021: Over the last few weeks I have been working on an assignment for a course. In this assignment we are to conduct an experiment to test which is faster for tablet input, the index finger or the thumb. The measurement used to determine which has higher throughput is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" target="_blank">Fitts's law</a>. Simply put, this is a measure that is said to be able to predict how fast a person can move from one target to another with a disance A and a target of size W. Aside from learning what Fitts's law is, I also learned about react native which is the environment my partner and I used to implement this experiment. It has been amazing learning the ins and outs of react native even though I feel I have only scratched the surface. Further, I learned that the index finger has higher throughput than the thumb on tablets through our experiment.</p>

                <p>16 Feb, 2021: I have learned a couple things this week but I am a bit behind during this busy season, so I am hoping that I can catch up over this week as I have the reading week break. To discuss one thing, for one of my courses I had to pick a teaching technology and write about how it works from the student and the teacher perspectives. The technology I chose to explore was <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html" target="_blank">Data Structure Visualizations</a> because I love Visualizations of complex data structures and algorithms. From the student perspective, I have used this to get a better image of how some algorithms work and have used these kinds of tools as a way to work through what I think the algorithm will do in a given situation with a given input. For the teachers, the creator Dr. David Gallas made the code available to be extended. I implemented a simple sorting algorithm to understand the framework he has created, which I learned runs almost entirely on JS. As a person with limited JS experience, it was amazing to program JS in an environment that has visual feedback for the algorithms being implemented as I am a visual thinker. This was not in the report I wrote for the course but it feels worth discussing here. </p>

                <p>7 Feb, 2021: This week I read a paper about <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221192597_A_Particle_Swarm_Optimization-Based_Heuristic_for_Scheduling_Workflow_Applications_in_Cloud_Computing_Environments" target="_blank">Particle swarm optimization</a>. The concept is to have many particles that are given properties of the problem to solve and each one goes off on their own to attempt to solve the problem. A given particle compares how well it did with its own best attempt as well as the global best attempt. The context of this article was cloud computing resources and attempting to optimize some aspect of it, like least possible execution time. I tried to understand all the math but some of it went over my head, but I am interested to do some more reading. This idea came from ants, since they each perform their own tasks yet are known to be very efficient creatures. According to the paper, this type of optimization algorithm is accurate yet efficient at finding solutions and has been applied to solving other NP-Hard problems.</p>

                <p>31 Jan, 2021 (edited: 7 Feb, 2021): I recently got a new amp as a gift! I love how it sounds. I noticed that because my amp was broken and I was not able to play properly, it deterred me from wanting to learn new songs since they always sounded bad when I played them on my amp. Now that I have a new amp, I noticed how bad the state of my old amp was and I am noticing that I am wanting to play again and that I want to learn more about music. <br /><br /> 
                    
                Over the years I have taught myself to play the guitar. Since I learned it myself, I have noticed that my learning does not always follow a structure and I learn things out of order. Or, as with chords, I learned them so long ago and have forgotten many of them since my style is rock and metal music which do not often use chords. <br /><br /> 
                    
                Yesterday was the first time that I jammed with a friend, he plays drums. We played a few songs that we both like, we are both fans of System of a down, and though it requires more practice I think we sounded good. One thing that I started reading into more in the last few days are scales. I had heard of scales in music many times before and had some idea of what they are but never learned what they are formally and what they are for guitar. My basic understanding is that there are preset combinations of strings and frets (i.e. the vertical bars on the neck of the guitar) that sound nice and I think scales are also used to make chords. I hope that learning scales will give me the ability to improvise more when playing, which I notice is not something that I am particularly good at yet.</p>

                <p>20 Jan, 2021: I have great interest in machine learning and took a few courses that taught me more about them. I really loved learning the concepts but have since forgotten some of the things that I have learned. As I was refreshing my knowledge I had the sudden urge to program <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ridge-regression-for-better-usage-2f19b3a202db" target="_blank">Ridge Regression</a> on a live setting where the user can add points and see how well the line fits them. I planned to do Ridge regression but for now only Linear Regression is implemented. The thing that is missing is the error. I have made the <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Ridge_Regression" target="_blank">code</a> I wrote public, it's not the cleanest but it demonstrates some of the key points of the model.</p>

                <p>8 Jan, 2021: I have attempted using Unity before for making games a year or so ago but the first time I touched it I did not get far. For this reason, I stopped the project for the time and started some tutorials. A friend of mine sent me the <a href="https://studentgamedev.blogspot.com/2013/08/unity-voxel-tutorial-part-1-generating.html" target="_blank">Unity Voxel Tutorial</a>. The tutorial goes over how to generate a gameobjects mesh and how to shape it after. For example, after creating 2D terrain, it used ray tracing to make caves by casting a line through the map. This was a really fun tutorial to follow and very informative. Since then, I have started a project with another friend in unity. There has been good progress in the project and my friend is very patient as I take longer on simple tasks than he does.</p>

                <p>6 Jan, 2021: For one of my courses I had to implement topic modelling using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gensim/" target="_blank">Gensim</a> library. There is a generative statistical model called Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The project was based on a paper called <a href="https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/sthomas/data/Barua_2012_EMSE.pdf" target="_blank">What are developers talking about? An analysis of topics and trends in Stack Overflow</a>. As the title suggests, the point of the article is to analyze what topics developers are talking about and how those trends change over the time spanning from July 2008 to September 2010, which involved around 3.5 million posts. They were able to find significant trends. In our project we were only able to sample 50,000 posts from 3 million ranging from February 2020 to September 2020. However, insignificant, the results we found were interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed learning to use this new modelling tool. Due to this being made for a course, I am not sure if I am allowed to make this code public. Given this limitation, I may write a similar code again and fix the things I did not like the first time and republish the code. This might be a large undertaking and I am currently working on other projects which limits my time. I will, however, be discussing my other projects in later blog entries. </p>

                <p>5 Jan, 2021 (edited 7, Feb 2021): First entry. I am excited to start a blog. I have wanted to start a blog for some time where I can discuss the projects I have worked on in the past and present, as well as future projects that I hope to tackle. Given the nature of some of my projects, there might be limited things I can discuss, but I still look forward to discussing what I can. Further, I may also discuss various things about new things that are being introduced in the computer science world. Lastly, I will discuss things that I have learned on my own or for other reasons like work or school. Since I have various interests including plants, animals, playing guitar, computers and gaming, amongst other things that strike my interest.</p>
