This is a webiste featuring some of the work I have done in the past.<br />
Some of the source code of these programs was provided by the instructor and
such code will not be posted. Some of the programs are entirely mine and the code is made public.<br />
Other code may have a "public vesion" where I took out everything in the code that isn't strictly
code that was written by me.<p>

<h1>Emanuel Wiens</h1>
<HR>
<p>
Student at the University of Manitoba.<br />
Bachelor of Computer Science Honours.<br />
Expected to graduation: 2020</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>I have been programming since about 2011 and have since worked a lot with C#, Java, Assembly, C++,
Processing, HTML and CSS. And I have sufficient experience with Python, Ruby, SQL, Javascript, ARM
Assembly, and C.</p>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>Microsoft Visual Studio. Ubuntu Linux. Clion. Robotics. ROS (Robot Operating System). Android studio.
Raspberry Pi.</p>




<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I usually choose to make games and simulations. Such as graphical simulations or conceptual ones like
cache simulations. However, I enjoyed making distributed programs.
I absolutely love space travel, colonization, and physics. There is so much about space we don't
know and so much that humans can gain from being able to travel to other planets. For now, I will
stick to enjoying space simulations and games. <br /><br />
I have also worked with robotics and like to think about all the practical applications that we can
gain from developing better technology to help us discover and analyze the world.
I have lots of plants and I enjoy taking care of them and watching them grow, it feels like a real
world simulation. This may also tie in why I like making simulations that show some kind of growth
over time. Of course the bigger a simulation is allowed to get the harder it becomes to scale.<br />
Imagine a game where the environment is entirely simulated to the point where the plants grow and
die, that is one of my dreams.
<br /><br />
This is a website featuring some of the work I have done in the past that I am proud of. The source
code will also be added if it's public.
