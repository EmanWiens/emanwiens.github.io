Some of the source code of these programs was provided by the instructor and
such code will not be posted. Some of the programs are entirely mine and the code is made public.<br />
Other code may have a "public vesion" where I took out everything in the code that isn't strictly
code that was written by me.<p>

<h1>Emanuel Wiens</h1>
<HR>
<p>
Student at the University of Manitoba.<br />
Bachelor of Computer Science Honours.<br />
Expected to graduation: 2020</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>I have been programming since about 2011 and have since worked a lot with C#, Java, Assembly, C++, Processing, HTML and CSS. And I have sufficient experience with Python, Ruby, SQL, Javascript, ARM Assembly, and C.</p>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>Microsoft Visual Studio. Ubuntu Linux. Clion. Robotics. ROS (Robot Operating System). Android studio. Raspberry Pi.</p>




<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I usually choose to make games and simulations. Such as graphical simulations or conceptual ones like cache simulations. However, I enjoyed making distributed programs.
I absolutely love space travel, colonization, and physics. There is so much about space we don't know and so much that humans can gain from being able to travel to other planets. For now, I will stick to enjoying space simulations and games. <br /><br />
I have also worked with robotics and like to think about all the practical applications that we can gain from developing better technology to help us discover and analyze the world.
I have lots of plants and I enjoy taking care of them and watching them grow, it feels like a real world simulation. This may also tie in why I like making simulations that show some kind of growth over time. Of course the bigger a simulation is allowed to get the harder it becomes to scale.<br />
Imagine a game where the environment is entirely simulated to the point where the plants grow and die, that is one of my dreams. 
<br /><br />
This is a website featuring some of the work I have done in the past that I am proud of. The source code will also be added if it's public.

<h2>Planet Colonizer, Summer 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This is a personal projects that I took worked on through the summer. 
It's a simulation that "populates" the planets and its moons. There are calculations based on real population growth and decay, as well as a max population that can be supported on a given planet. And, of course these numbers are based on real statistics. Otherwise, where's the fun? <br/><br/>

The code is left open for future extensions such as adding limited resources to the planets and having some user controlled aspects of the simulation. As of now it only includes our solar system (not all pictured). Again, the code is made so it's easily extensible so it would not be hard to add a component to procedurally generate more solar systems. So it is possible to have the simulation be as infinite as the real universe.

<div class="itemRight">
<h2>Environmental Engine, Summer 2016</h2>
<HR>
<p>Another personal project that simulates growing grass using particles. This whole program is procedurally generated. Each 'root' is made up of several blades of grass and each blade of grass is made up of several particles. The grass can grow and be mowed. I also worked on making it sway in the wind which was a challenge. <br/><br/>

I have since learned more about optimizing code and different strategies that I could have used to accomplish similar things, but I enjoyed writing it. When I wrote this program I didn't know that this is technically a particle system, I just had the idea and wanted to try it.

<h2>Particle System, Fall 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This is a particle system that I did for an assignment and then later slightly modified. It's a rather simple program, but I it was fun to make. I also like the idea of using small particles to simulate things like smoke and fire.<br /><br />

The particles have mass and slightly change color on every collision, which is only noticeable when the program runs for a few seconds.

<h2>3D free walk, Fall 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This is a program that I am particularly proud of. I had programmed many 2D animations but nothing in 3D. The reason was that I never knew where to start with it, and it was scary. This was an assignment I had to tackle in class and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.<br /><br />

In this program you are able to freely walk in a 3D space and look at some 3D animations. I also added collision detection to prevent the player from being able to walk through walls and exhibits (the floating pictures). The images are given at various sizes, I had to add a short algorithm that scales the images down to an expected size. <br /><br />
