This is a webiste featuring some of the work I have done in the past.<br />
Some of the source code of these programs was provided by the instructor and
such code will not be posted. Some of the programs are entirely mine and the code is made public.<br />
Other code may have a "public vesion" where I took out everything in the code that isn't strictly
code that was written by me.<p>

<h1>Emanuel Wiens</h1>
<HR>
<p class="me">
Student at the University of Manitoba.<br />
Bachelor of Computer Science Honours.<br /><br />
I have been programming since about 2011 and have since worked a lot with C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and Java. And I have sufficient experience with Python, Ruby, SQL, Javascript, ARM Assembly, and C.<br /><br />
I usually choose to make games and simulations. Such as graphical simulations or conceptual ones like cache simulations. However, I enjoyed making distributed programs.<br /><br /> 

This is a webiste featuring some of the work I have done in the past that I am proud of. The source code will also be added if it's public.<br /><br />

<h2>Particle System, Fall 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This is a particle system that I had to do for an assignent and then later slightly modified. It's a rather simple program, but I really enjoyed writing it. I also like the idea of using small particles to simulate things like smoke and fire.<br /><br />
The particles have mass and slightly change color on every collision.<br /><br />

<div class="itemRight">
<h2>3D free walk, Fall 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This is a program that I am particularly proud of. I had programmed many 2D animations but nothing in 3D. The reason was that I never knew where to start with it, and it was scary. This was an assignment I had to tackle in class and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.<br /><br />
This does not involve much more than being able to freely walk in a 3D space and some 3D animations. I also added collision detection to prevent the player from being able to walk through walls and exhibits (the floating pictures).<br /><br />
