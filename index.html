                <p>20 Jan, 2020: I have great interest in machine learning and took a few courses that taught me more about them. I really loved learning the concepts but have since forgotten some of the things that I have learned. As I was refreshing my knowledge I had the sudden urge to program <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens/Ridge_Regression" target="_blank">Ridge Regression</a> on a live setting where the user can add points and see how well the line fits them. I planned to do Ridge regression but for now only Linear Regerssion is implemented.</p>

                <p>8 Jan, 2020: I have attempted using Unity before for making games a year or so ago but the first time I touched it I did not get far. For this reason, I stopped the project for the time and started some tutorials. A friend of mine sent me the <a href="https://studentgamedev.blogspot.com/2013/08/unity-voxel-tutorial-part-1-generating.html" target="_blank">Unity Voxel Tutorial</a>. The tutorial goes over how to generate a gameobjects mesh and how to shape it after. For example, after creating 2D terrain, it used ray tracing to make caves by casting a line through the map. This was a really fun tutorial to follow and very informative. Since then, I have started a project with another friend in unity. There has been good progress in the project and my friend is very patient as I take longer on simple tasks than he does.</p>

                <p>6 Jan, 2020: For one of my courses I had to implement topic modelling using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gensim/" target="_blank">Gensim</a> library. There is a generative statistical model called Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The project was based on a paper called <a href="https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/sthomas/data/Barua_2012_EMSE.pdf" target="_blank">What are developers talking about? An analysis of topics and trends in Stack Overflow</a>. As the title suggests, the point of the article is to analyze what topics developers are talking about and how those trends change over the time spanning from July 2008 to September 2010, which involved around 3.5 million posts. They were able to find significant trends. In our project we were only able to sample 50,000 posts from 3 million ranging from February 2020 to September 2020. However, insignificant, the results we found were interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed learning to use this new modelling tool. Due to this being made for a course, I am not sure if I am allowed to make this code public. Given this limitation, I may write a similar code again and fix the things I did not like the first time and republish the code. This might be a large undertaking and I am currently working on other projects which limits my time. I will, however, be discussing my other projects in later blog entries. </p>

                <p>5 Jan, 2020: First entry. I am excited to start a blog. I have wanted to start a blog for some time where I can discuss the projects I have worked on in the past and present, as well as future projects that I hope to tackle. Further, I may also discuss various things about new things that are being introduced in the computer science world. Given the nature of some of my projects, there might be limited things I can discuss, but I still look forward to discussing them. For now, there are projects from the past that I want to discuss and I will spend the next few days discussing those projects. Hopefully, once I am caught up I will be writing about my projects as they happen rather than after the fact.</p>
