Some of the source code of these programs was provided by the instructor and
such code will not be posted. Some of the programs are entirely mine and the code is made public.<br />
Other code may have a "public vesion" where I took out everything in the code that isn't strictly
code that was written by me.<p>

<h1>Emanuel Wiens</h1>
<HR>
<p class="me">
Student at the University of Manitoba.<br />
Bachelor of Computer Science Honours.<br /><br />
I have been programming since about 2011 and have since worked a lot with C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and Java. And I have sufficient experience with Python, Ruby, SQL, Javascript, ARM Assembly, and C.<br /><br />
I usually choose to make games and simulations. Such as graphical simulations or conceptual ones like cache simulations. However, I enjoyed making distributed programs.<br /><br /> 

This is a webiste featuring some of the work I have done in the past that I am proud of. The source code will also be added if it's public.<br />

<h2>Planet Colonizer, Summer 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This was one of my personal projects that I took up on that I worked on through the summer.<br/>
It's a simulation that "populates" the planets and its moons. As of now it only includes our solar system (not all pictured).<br/><br/>
I really enjoy solar system related games and simulations. I would love to make my own large scale simulation or game centered around solar system exploration one day.<br/>

<div class="itemRight">
<h2>Environmental Engine, Summer 2016</h2>
<HR>
<p>This was a simulation for growing grass using particles. This whole program is procedurally generated. Each 'root' is made up of several blades of grass and each blade of grass is made up of seveal particles. The grass can grow and be mowed. I also worked on making it sway in the wind which was a challenge. <br/><br/>
I have learned a lot since then about optimizing code and different strategies that I could have used to accomplish similar things, but I enjoyed writing it. When I wrote this program I didn't know that this is technically a particle system as well.

<h2>Particle System, Fall 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This is a particle system that I had to do for an assignent and then later slightly modified. It's a rather simple program, but I really enjoyed writing it. I also like the idea of using small particles to simulate things like smoke and fire.<br /><br />
The particles have mass and slightly change color on every collision.<br /><br />

<div class="pannelItem"> 
<div class="itemRight">
<h2>3D free walk, Fall 2018</h2>
<HR>
<p>This is a program that I am particularly proud of. I had programmed many 2D animations but nothing in 3D. The reason was that I never knew where to start with it, and it was scary. This was an assignment I had to tackle in class and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.<br /><br />
This does not involve much more than being able to freely walk in a 3D space and some 3D animations. I also added collision detection to prevent the player from being able to walk through walls and exhibits (the floating pictures).<br /><br />
