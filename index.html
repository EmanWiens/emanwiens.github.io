<p class="me">Emanuel Wiens. <br />
Feel free to browse my <a href="https://github.com/EmanWiens" target="_blank">Github</a>.<br />
Student at the University of Manitoba.<br />
Bachelor of Computer Science Honours.<br />
This is a webiste featuring some of the work I have done in the past.<br />
Some of the source code of these programs was provided by the instructor and
such code will not be posted. Some of the programs are entirely mine and the code is made public.<br />
Other code may have a "public vesion" where I took out everything in the code that isn't strictly
code that was written by me.<p>
